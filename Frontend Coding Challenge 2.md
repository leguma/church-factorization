# Elyah Coding Challenge

## Assessment Rubric

This coding test will assess: overall design, creativity, and code quality, and will be graded on these 3 areas.

Overall Design: The candidate must exhibit some understanding of overall page design. This includes layout, clarity, and originality, and ease of navigation. The user experience is taken into consideration here: it is necessary that the page is simple enough for any new user to grasp without much background knowledge.

Creativity: The candidate must exhibit an understanding of appropriate color schemes, originality of interactive components, and clarity of user experience. The interactive key is a crucial design component, and should add value to the user.

Code Quality: High quality code includes a lack of redundant code, appropriate CSS structure, and manageable frontend code. Unmanageable code often lacks structure, and is harder to maintain in the long term.

## Task:

The candidate is required to build a an interactive interface that takes in any number from 1-200 and shows its constituents in a fashion similar to Church Numerals. For example, if the user inputs 8, it should break it down to two 4's, four 2's, and eight 1's, and visualize this breakdown completely.

## Conditions:

-- The candidate may choose a subject of their choice, and create a dashboard for that subject.
-- Only one page is required. One large scrollable webpage is acceptable as well.
-- The webpage must include one component that interacts with a keyboard action. Ex. pressing [#insert_key] should display a change on the screen.


## Extra Credit

The dashboard is able to connect with another data outlet in the backend.
